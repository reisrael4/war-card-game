# Game of War - Project 2
Using Javascript I created a functional War cardgame that runs in the browser console. I used Object Oriented Programming to create the cards and the deck and wrote a series of functions to set up the gameplay. The biggest challenge for me had to do with ensuring that the gameplay would run smoothly, particularly ensuring the cards were randomized and that the correct numbe of cards was in play at any given time. This project was a challenge, but not impossible by any means.
