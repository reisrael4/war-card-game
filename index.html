    <h1>The goal of the game of War is to be the first player to have all 52 cards in your hand!</h1>
    <h2>How to play:</h2>
    <p>Each player flips the first card in their hand face up on the table. Whichever player flips the larger card adds both to the bottom of their hand. If the value of the cards match, it is war.</p>
    <h2>War:</h2>
    <p>Each player places three cards facedown next to their original card and then flip a fourth face up. Just as in a regular round, whichever player flips a higher value card adds all of the cards in play to their hand. If the cards match again war continues until someone plays a higher card.</p>
    <h3>The game ends when one player has all 52 cards.</h3>
